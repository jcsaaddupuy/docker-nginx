docker-nginx
============

A simple Nginx image for Docker to serve static websites. It will serve anything in the directory `/var/www`.

You'll need to use a `Dockerfile` to build an image with your site in it. For example, if your site is in a directory called `src/`, you could create this `Dockerfile`:

    FROM orchardup/nginx
    ADD src/ /var/www
    CMD 'nginx'

Then build and run it:

    $ docker build -t mysite .
    ...

    $ docker run -p 80:80 -d mysite
    da809981545f
    $ curl localhost
    ...
